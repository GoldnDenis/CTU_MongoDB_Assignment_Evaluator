Implement the project block with MongoDB
Explicitly create one or two collections (for example, one collection for orders or two collections: orders and order_items)
I.e., create it using createCollection method
Insert 10 documents into each collection
These documents must be realistic, non-trivial, and with both embedded objects and arrays
Interlink the documents using references
Use both insertOne and insertMany
Express update operations:
Replace the value of the document
Update an individual field of one document
Update an individual field in documents by criterion; use a formula or increase/multiply the value
Add and remove a field in the document(s)
Modify a nested document
Replace, add, and delete a single array element
Use the upsert mode at least once
Express at least 5 find queries (with non-trivial selections, i.e. the first parameter cannot be empty)
Use at least one logical operator ($and, $or, $not)
Use $elemMatch operator on array fields at least once
Use both positive and negative projections (each at least once)
Use sort modifier
The search criteria should contain (each item at least once):
matching the value of one or more fields
condition on the value of one or more fields (e.g., containing greater than or less than, etc.)
comparing dates or parts of dates (for example, all orders for a given date or all orders for a given year)
matching the whole array
searching for a value in the array
Describe the real-world meaning of all your queries in comments
Express 5 aggregate operations. Use 2 created collections for entities of different types. If necessary, insert more documents into each one of them
Use at least once each of $match, $group, $sort, $project (or $addFields), $skip and $limit stages
Use at least once each of $sum (or $avg), $count, $min (or $max), $first (or $last) aggregators
Use lookup (if you have two collections)
